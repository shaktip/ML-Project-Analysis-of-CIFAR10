Image Recognition

Feature extraction techniques are implemented in Matlab -

SIFT
SURF
Logistic regression is implemented with accuracy of 33%. Please check "Logistic Regression.ipynb" file for more details.

K Nearest Neighbor is implemented with maximum accuracy of 29%. Please check "KNN CIFAR 10.ipynb" file for more details.

Support Vector Machine is implemented with maximum accuracy of 36%. Please check "KNN CIFAR 10.ipynb" file for more details.

Two layer fully connected Neural newtork is implemented with maximum accuracy of 45%. Accuracy was increased by increasing the number of training iterations.

GMM is implemented with maximum accuracy of 34%.

K-means is implemented with accuracy of 36.8%.

CNN is implemented with the accuracy of 86% after iterating for 30-40 times. Please check file FinalCNN.ipynb for more details
